Some Definitions
1) n_ion: number of ion types
2) n_node: number of nodes for a mesh

Linear System [K]*{u}={b}
1) {u}: column vector of length (n_ion+2)*n_node, where
   on each node u is a vector of length n_ion+2, that is
   number of ions plus potential plus surface charge density
2) [K]: matrix of size [(n_ion+2)*n_node]**2
3) {b}: column vector of length (n_ion+2)*n_node


Code Optimization To-Do List (Take n_ion = 2 for example)

1. Re-structure [K],{u}, and {b} so that the order of {u} becomes
   (u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4)_for_node_1, (u_1,u_2,u_3,u_4)_for_node_2, etc.
  
2. Decouple [K] so that [K] = [K_1] + [K_2], where
   [K_1] is static and [K_2] needs to be re-computed for different
   frequencies
   
3. Modify subroutines in computing elementary [K] and {b} 
   so that they will skip elements if the processor_id does not 
   equal to the processor_flags_for_elements
   
4. Compute basis functions for all elements one time and re-use them

5. Seperate mesh generation/material property setup from the main code
